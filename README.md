# Distributed Estimation of Ï€

This system was built as a weekend assignment for the
Data Storage Technology and Networks course at 
[BITS - Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus][1], under the guidance
of Dr. Biju K. R.

## Synopsis

   * We used [Beanstalkd][2] for our message queue.
   * We used [Beanstalkc][3] for Python bindings.
   * Our system is *fully worker-fault-tolerant*.
   * Our system is *partially server-fault-tolerant*.

A detailed description of the decision process and system design
is available on my [blog][4].
